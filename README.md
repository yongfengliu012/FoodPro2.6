# FoodPro2.6
An Android application to track daily Calorie activities for personals 
In this project, an offline Calorie tracking application operating on Android mobile phones named FoodPro, 
has been developed and serves as a very convenient tool to not only keep track of the Calorie amounts, 
but also help people plan daily meals and exercises. 
Besides, some novel features such as food recommending and meal analyzing compared to other
applications are also included to help users choose healthy meals and analyze Calorie intake for a period of time. 
Been developed as a native application on Android system, FoodPro, eliminates annoying built-in advertising to 
prevent userâ€™s information being stolen and also provide better user experience.
